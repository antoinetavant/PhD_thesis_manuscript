\section{Key phenomena of \ac{HET}}

Even though \ac{HET} have been studied and used for more than 40 years, some keep phenomena are still ill-understood, driving their development by manufacturers to a {\emph trial and error} method.
These key phenomena are
\begin{itemize}
  \item the electron transport toward the anode
  \item the plasma-surface interaction 
  \item the wall erosion, limiting the lift-time of \ac{HET}s
  \item the propellant nature
\end{itemize}
