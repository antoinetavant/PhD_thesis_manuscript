\chapter{Anisothermal sheath}
\label{ch-3}

The presence of azimuthal instabilities in the Hall effect thrusters has first been showed with numerical simulations by \citet{adam2004}.
However, it nature is not yet fully understood.
In this chapter, we investigate the instabilities observed in the \ac{2D} \ac{PIC} simulations.

First, we derive the dispersion relation without hypothesis on the particle distribution function.
Then, we present a numerical algorithm that solves the dispersion relation using the distribution function measured in the \ac{PIC} simulations.
Then, the oscillations observed in the simulation are compared to the results of the dispersion relation.
