\chapter{Evolution of the azimuthal instability and generalized dispersion relation}
\label{ch-5}

\headerchaptername{Evolution of the instability and general DR}


\begin{Chabstract}
  
As briefly mentioned in \cref{ch-1}, the $E \times B$ configuration of the \ac{HET} gives rise to azimuthal instabilities.
This aspect has been neglected in \cref{ch-2,ch-3}, except by its consequences on the axial electron transport.
While these instabilities have been the subject of numerous studies, they remain unclear.

Using the results of the \ac{PIC} simulations, we propose new insights for the understanding on the instability, hence the electron cross-field transport.
In particular, we develop a relation dispersion solver that uses the velocity distribution function measured in the simulations.
Then, we compare the simulation instability characteristics with the dispersion relations.
A special care is taken with the boundary condition and the instability non-linear saturation.
