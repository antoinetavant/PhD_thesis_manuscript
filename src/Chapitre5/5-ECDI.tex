\label{ch-5}

\headerchaptername{Evolution of the instability and general DR}


\begin{Chabstract}
  
As briefly mentioned previously, the $E \times B$ configuration of the \ac{HET} gives rise to azimuthal instabilities.
These instabilities are important for the behavior of the \ac{HET}, as they are responsible for the electron cross-field transport.
Even if these instabilities have been the subject of numerous studies, they are still not well understood.
Using the \ac{PIC} simulations, we propose new insights for the understanding of the instability.
In particular, we develop a dispersion relation solver that uses the velocity distribution function measured in the simulations.
Then, we compare the simulation instability characteristics with the dispersion relations.
A special care is taken with the boundary condition and the instability non-linear saturation.
