  In \Cref{ch-2}, a discrepancy between the expected plasma-wall interaction quantities -- as the plasma potential drop through the sheath and the electron emission rate -- and the \ac{PIC} simulation results has been observed.
  In this chapter, we carry out a detailed analysis of the simulation results presented in \cref{ch-2}  in order to gain more insight on the plasma-wall interaction.
  We develop a simplified simulation in order to isolate the plasma-wall interaction from the rest of the phenomena.
  This new \ac{PIC} simulation is one-dimensional in space and three-dimensional in velocity (\acs{1D}-\acs{3V}), un-magnetized, and without electron emission.
  From this simplified simulation, we derived a non-isothermal sheath model, that describes well the kinetic simulations.
  We also extend the model to the case where ionization is self-consistent.
