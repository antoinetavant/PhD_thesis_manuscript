\chapter{Anisothermal sheath}
\label{ch-3}

In order to explain the discrepancy observed in \cref{ch-2} between the simulation and the sheath model, we investigate the simulation data.
We see that the hypothesis of the sheath model do not stand.
Using a simplified \ac{1D} \ac{PIC} simulation, we derive a polytropic closure for the electron.
With this new closure equation, we derived a modified sheath model, that fit well the kinetic simulations.
