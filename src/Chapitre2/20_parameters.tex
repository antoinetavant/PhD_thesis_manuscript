\section{Presentation of study}
  \label{sec-params}
  
  \begin{Chabstract}
    
  This study is based on the preliminary work of V. Croes, that he has presented in his Ph.D. thesis \citep{croes2017}.
  Based on this results, I continued the analyze which has been published in  \citet*{tavant2018}.

  As introduced in \Cref{ch-1}, the \ac{HET} behaviour is dependent of the axial electron transport toward the anode across the magnetic barrier.
  Two main phenomena are proposed to enhance the electron mobility,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item plasma instabilities and in particular the azimuthal \ac{ECDI}
    \item the electron induced electron emission from the wall
  \end{itemize}
  In order to compare quantitatively the relative importance of the two phenomena, we propose to conduct a parametric study on the dielectric wall characteristics.

  As highlighted before, the \ac{ECDI} rises due to the $E \times B$ electron drift, but saturates thanks to the axial convection model.
  Before investigating the time dependent behaviour of the system, we focus in this \Cref{ch-2} on the average values at steady state.
  The first section describes the parameters of the simulation, 
  while the second section highlights the main characteristics of the simulation results.

  
  The simulation domain corresponds to the exit plane of the thruster.
  Hence, a neutral pressure $P_n$ of 0.1~mTorr and a plasma density $n_e$ of $\sn{1}{17}$ m$^{-3}$ are used.
  The fixed axial electric field and radial magnetic field are $E_z=\sn{2}{4}\,\volt\per\meter$ s and $B_r=200$ G, respectively.
  The rectangular \ac{2D} domain measures $L_r=2$~cm in the radial dimension and $L_{\theta}=0.5$~cm in the azimuthal direction.
  The axial length used for the convection is fixed at $L_z=1$~cm.
  It is important to note that the results shown in this chapter have been obtained at the beginning of my thesis, before the study of the convection presented in \cref{ch-1}.
  Hence, in this chapter we use the convection model of \citet{lafleur2016a}.
  However, we have validated at posteriori that the convection model used does not modify the results under the conditions studied.
  
  The numerical parameters are chosen to respect the stability criterion of \ac{PIC} simulation, and are presented in \Cref{parameters}
