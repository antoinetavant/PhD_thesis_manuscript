\section{Modeling the dielectric layer }
  \label{sec-diel_layer}
  
  The first effect of the wall material studied is the layer of dielectric, as introduced in \Cref{sec-diel}.
  The simulation parameters are the same as in \cref{sec-canonical}, but the plasma is separated from the ground wall by a dielectric layer of 3~cm.
  The relative permittivity of the dielectric is $\epsr=25$

  \subsection{Effect of the dielectric layer} \label{subsec-effect_mob}
  
  The simulation results presents qualitatively the same results as the case without the dielectric layer.
  As an example, \Cref{fig-mod_diel_comp} shows the temporal evolution of the axial electron mobility with and without the dielectric layer.
  We can see a small difference, but not really significant concerning the physical origin of the electron enhanced mobility, and the effect of the dielectric layer.
  The other variables (mean electron temperature, radial profiles, and so on) follow the same conclusion.

  \subsection{Near wall parameters} \label{subsec-nearwall}
    Let focus on the surface charge and the near wall electric field.
    \Cref{fig-sigma_time} shows the temporal evolution of the surface charge at one point of the wall.
    The position has been chosen to be the center ($L_{\theta} = 0.25$~cm) of the lower wall, but the observations are similar at other positions.

      \caption{Temporal evolution of the surface charges at one position}
      \label{fig-sigma_time}
    \end{figure}
  
    We can see on \cref{fig-sigma_time} that the surface charge oscillates around a mean value close to $-4.5$ nC/m$^2$ and an amplitude of around 1 nC/m$^2$.

  \subsection{Dielectric model comparison} \label{subsec-modelcomp}
  
  As introduced in \cref{sec-diel}, another possibility to model the effect of the surface charges on the plasma is to use a Neumann boundary condition [{\bf REF}]
  \begin{equation} \label{eq-neuman}
    E_r = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}.
  \end{equation}
  \Cref{eq-neuman} uses two approximations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item one dimensional
    \item No electric field in the dielectric
  \end{itemize}
  
  \Cref{fig-er_time} shows the radial electric field inside of the dielectric and compare the electric field at the wall and compares it to \cref{eq-neuman}.

    \caption{Temporal evolution of ({\bf a}) the radial electric field near the wall at the same azimuthal position than \cref{fig-sigma_time}, and ({\bf b}) the comparison with the near wall electric field and  \cref{eq-neuman}, using the surface charge of \cref{fig-sigma_time}. }
    \label{fig-er_time}
  \end{figure}
  
  We can see on \cref{fig-er_time}.{\bf a} that the electric field in the wall in not zero, but oscillates around a value close to zero ($\sim 100$~V/m).
  Its amplitude is of the order of $4$~kV/m.
  
  \Cref{fig-er_time}.{\bf b} shows the near-wall  radial electric field compared to \cref{eq-neuman} at the same position than \cref{fig-sigma_time}.
  We can see that the two values are of the same order of magnitude, close to $-500$~kV/m.
  However, the two values are not strictly equal, but the maximum error between the two are only of the order of $20\%$, which mean that the \ac{RMS} error is around 10\%.
