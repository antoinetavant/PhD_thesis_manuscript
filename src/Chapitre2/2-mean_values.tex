\label{ch-2}
Structure :

{\bf II. Parametric study of the dielectric} 30 pages
\begin{zzz}
  This chapter takes the 1rst paper which uses Vivien's results.

  2.1 Fully metallic wall (no SEE, grounded).

  2.2 Impact of Dielectric layer without SEE

  2.3 Impact of SEE with grounded wall

  2.4 SEE and dielectric in the same time

  2.5 Discrepancy between $\mean{\Te}$, $\sigma_{PIC}$ and $\sigma_{theo} = \sigma_0 + (1 - \sigma_0) \frac{2 T_e}{\epsilon_0}$
\end{zzz}


In \Cref{ch-1}, we describe the simulation domain and the numerical models used.
As highlighted, the \ac{ECDI} rises due to the $E \times B$ electron drift, but saturate thanks to the axial convection model.
Before investigating the time dependent characteristics of the system, we focus in this \Cref{ch-2} on the average values at steady state.
A parametric study has been conducted on the radial boundary condition, on both the dielectric layer model in the Poisson equation, and the electron emission.
