\section{Dielectrics boundary condition}
  \label{sec-diel}

  \Cref{fig-2dschemat} shows the simulation of the radial-azimuthal domain with metallic grounded walls.
  \Cref{fig-2D} illustrates the configuration in the radial-azimuthal planehighlighting the more realistic radial boundary conditions.
  The plasma is bounded in the radial direction by dielectric layers isolating the magnetic circuit.
  The magnetic circuit can be considered electrically grounded.

  The particles are absorbed when touching the dielectric wall, and we suppose an infinite residence time.
  Hence, we obtain a surface charge $\sigma$ at a time $t$ with
  \begin{equation} \label{eq-sigmaintegrate}
    \sigma(t) = e \int_0^t (J_i - J_e) dt
  \end{equation}
  with $J_i$ and $J_e$ the ion and electron flux respectively and $e$ is the elementary charge and supposing that there is no surface charge at the interface at the beginning.

    \label{fig-2D}
  \end{figure}


  A common approach is to suppose that the electric field inside the dielectric is zero \citep{taccogna2019}. 
  Using Gauss theorem, we obtain a Neumann boundary condition at the plasma-wall interface for the potential
  \begin{equation} \label{eq-gauss}
    \norm{\partial_r \phi} = \frac{\norm{\sigma}}{\epsilon_0}
  \end{equation}
  with $\sigma$ the surface charge and $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity.
  However, the electric field in a dielectric material is not zero, but depends on the global system.
  Hence, in order to model correctly the dielectric wall of the \ac{HET}, we choose to include the whole dielectric layers inside of the simulation domain.

  In this section, we derive the discretization of the Poisson equation with non-uniform permittivity in the \ac{2D} radial azimuthal plane using the finite volume approach.


  \subsection{Non-uniform mesh}

    In the dielectric layers, there is no particle nor charge.
    Hence, the numerical constraints on the cell size are not applicable, and the cell size can be increased.
    In order to reduce the cell size difference between two neighbouring cells, we use an exponential growth of the cell size in the radial direction.
    The cell size in the azimuthal direction $\dy$ is kept constant.
    The resulting non-uniform mesh can be seen in \cref{fig-2D}.


  \subsection{Poisson equation discretization}


  The dielectric permittivity is $\epsilon= \epsr \epsilon_0$ with $\epsr$ the relative permittivity of the dielectric.

  The Poisson equation with not-constant permittivity is
  \begin{equation} \label{eq-poissondiel}
    \grad \cdot \epsilon \grad \phi = \rho
  \end{equation}
  with $\rho$ the charge density.
  We note $\vect{D}=\epsilon \vect{E} = \epsilon \grad \phi$ the electric flux.

  \Cref{fig-decompo1} shows the Cartesian decomposition of the \ac{2D} domain.
  The cell $(i,j)$ has four direct neighbours\string:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the east $E$ in $(i+1,j)$
    \item the west $W$ in $(i-1, j)$
    \item the north $N$ in $(i, j+1)$
    \item the south $S$ in $(i, j-1)$
  \end{itemize}
  The cell dimensions are $\dx_{i,j}$ and $\dy_{i,j}$, and $\V=\dx_{i,j} \dy_{i,j}$ is the cell volume.
  As the mesh is Cartesian, we have for a given $j$ $\dx_{i,j} = cst$ for all $i$. Hence, we note $\dx_{i,j} = d_i$ and $\dy_{i,j} = d_j$

  The boundaries are noted $S^s_{i,j}$ with $s=E,W,N$ or $S$.
  We can see that $S^W_{i,j}=S^E_{i-1,j}$, and the same goes for the other borders.
  We note $\C = S^E_{i,j} \cup S^W_{i,j} \cup S^N_{i,j} \cup S^S_{i,j}$ the cell surface boundary.
  The center of the cell is located in $i,j$ and the borders are located in $i\pm 1/2$ in the East-West direction and $j\pm 1/2$ in the North-Sourth direction.

  \end{figure}


  \subsection{Poisson equation discretization}

    We start by positioning the plasma-dielectric interface on the surface between two cells.
    This means that the permittivity $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsr$ is  constant over a cell.
    In order to discretize the Poisson equation, we integrate \cref{eq-poissondiel} over the cell volume

    \begin{equation}
    \int_{\V} - \grad \cdot (\epsilon \grad \phi) dv= \int_{\V} \rho dv.
    \end{equation}
    Using Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem, we obtain
    \begin{equation}
    \oint_{\C} ( - \epsilon \grad \phi) \cdot \vect{n} dS = Q_{tot} =  \V \bar{\rho},
    \end{equation}
    with $\vect{n}$ the normal vector directed outward, $Q_{tot}$ is the total charge of the cell and $\bar{\rho}$ is the mean value of $\rho$ in the cell.
    We can decompose the integration over the cell boundary with the four surfaces $S^s_{i,j}$ as
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq-poissonsum}
    \oint_{\C} (-\epsilon \grad \phi) \cdot \vect{n} dS = \sum_{k\in(E,W,N,S)} S^k_{i,j} \vect{D}^k_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n}
    \end{equation}
    with $\vect{D}^k_{i,j}$ the flux through the surface $k$ of the cell $(i,j)$.


    \paragraph*{Electric flux \\}
    Let us define the electric flux through the East border  $\vect{D}^E_{i,j}$.
    We suppose there is no surface charges on $S^E$.
    We can hence write the electric flux as
    \begin{align} \label{eq-flux1}
      \vect{D}^E_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n} &= \epsilon_{i,j} E_{x, i+1/2,j}^-\\
                                      &= - \epsilon_{i,j} \frac{\phi_{i+1/2,j} - \phi_{i,j}}{d_i/2},
    \end{align}
    with an off-center discretization of the electric field.

    Using the Gauss's law without charges
    \begin{equation} \label{eq-gausslaw}
      \epsilon_{i,j}E_{x, i+1/2,j}^- - \epsilon_{i+1,j}E_{x, i+1/2,j}^+ =0,
    \end{equation}
    we have
    \begin{equation}
      \epsilon_{i,j} \frac{\phi_{i+1/2,j} - \phi_{i,j}}{d_i/2} = \epsilon_{i+1,j} \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - \phi_{i+1/2,j}}{d_{i+1}/2}.
    \end{equation}
    Hence
    \begin{equation} \label{eq-phidemi1}
      \phi_{i+1/2,j} = \frac{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} \phi_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_{i} \phi_{i+1,j} }{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_{i} },
    \end{equation}
    which corresponds to the usual discretization when $\epsilon$ and $d_i$ are both constant.
    Using \cref{eq-phidemi1} in \cref{eq-flux1} we obtain
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq-nosc}
    \vect{D}^E_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n} &=& 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j}\epsilon_{i+1,j}}{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_i} (\phi_{i,j}-\phi_{i+1,j})
    &=& 2\epsilon_0 \frac{\epsr{i,j}\epsr{i+1,j}}{\epsr{i,j}d_{i+1} + \epsr{i+1,j} d_i} (\phi_{i,j}-\phi_{i+1,j})
    \end{align}

    We note $Q^E_{i,j} \equiv \frac{\epsilon_{i,j} \epsilon_{i+1,j}}{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_i}$.
    reproducing the same decomposition on the other borders, we obtain
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq-descretPoisson1}
    S^E_{i,j} Q^E_{i,j} \phi_{i+1,j} + S^W_{i,j} Q^W_{i,j} \phi_{i-1,j} + S^N_{i,j} Q^N_{i,j} \phi_{i,j+1} + S^S_{i,j} Q^S_{i,j} \phi_{i,j-1} - Q^C_{i,j} \phi_{i,j} = - \V \bar{\rho_{i,j}}
    \end{equation}
    with
    \begin{center}
      $\begin{dcases}
     Q^E_{i,j} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j} \epsilon_{i+1,j}}{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_i} \\
     Q^W_{i,j} &= Q^E_{i-1,j} \\
     Q^N_{i,j} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j} \epsilon_{i,j+1}}{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{j+1} + \epsilon_{i,j+1} d_{j}}\\
     Q^S_{i,j} &= Q^N_{i-1,j} \\
     Q^C_{i,j} &= Q^E_{i,j}S^E_{i,j}+Q^W_{i,j}S^W_{i,j}+Q^N_{i,j}S^N_{i,j}+Q^S_{i,j}S^S_{i,j}
     \end{dcases}$
    \end{center}

    as well as $S^E_{i,j} = S^W_{i,j} =d_id_z, S^N_{i,j} = S^S_{i,j}= d_jd_z$ et $\V = d_jd_id_z$.
    We observe that the evolution of the relative permittivity and the cell size affects the coefficients to be used, but the system remains symmetric as we have $Q^S_{i,j} = Q^N_{i-1,j}$ and $ Q^W_{i,j} = Q^E_{i-1,j}$.
    
    A symmetric system is a linear system of equation $A \cdot X = B$  which matrix $A$ is equal to is transpose: $A = A^T$.
    It allows to reduce by a factor of two the memory needed to store the matrix.
    It also allows to use algorithm exploiting this aspect. For instance, the eigenvalues are real-valued, and the matrix factorisation only need to store one factor using Cholesky decomposition, which gives $A = L L^T$ with L an upper-triangular matrix. 

    \subsection{Including surfaces charges}
    Let's now considerer the presence of surface charges on the surface $S^E_{i,j}$.
    Gauss's law now reads
    \begin{equation} \label{eq-gausslawsc}
      -\epsilon_{i,j}E_{x, i+1/2,j}^- + \epsilon_{i+1,j}E_{x, i+1/2,j}^+ =\sigma^E,
    \end{equation}
    with $\sigma^E$ the surface charge on the surface.
    The surface charge is not taken into account when computing the total charge in a cell.
    Using the same discretization as before, we obtain
    \begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{i,j} \frac{\phi_{i+1/2,j} - \phi_{i,j}}{d_i/2} - \epsilon_{i+1,j} \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - \phi_{i+1/2,j}}{d_{i+1}/2} = \sigma^E
    \end{equation}
    so that
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq-phidemi}
    \phi_{i+1/2,j} = \frac{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} \phi_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_{i} \phi_{i+1,j} }{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_{i} } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^E \frac{d_i d_{i+1}}{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_{i}}
    \end{equation}
    hence
    \begin{align*}
    \vect{D}^E_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j}\epsilon_{i+1,j}}{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_i} (\phi_{i,j}-\phi_{i+1,j}) - \sigma^E \frac{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1}}{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1}+\epsilon_{i+1,j}d_{i}}
    \end{align*}
    We obtain the same relation that \cref{eq-nosc} updated by $- \sigma^E \frac{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1}}{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i+1}+\epsilon_{i+1,j}d_{i}}$

    Hence, we finally obtain
    \begin{equation}
    S^E_{i,j} Q^E_{i,j} \phi_{i+1,j} + S^W_{i,j} Q^W_{i,j} \phi_{i-1,j} + S^N_{i,j} Q^N_{i,j} \phi_{i,j+1} + S^S_{i,j} Q^S_{i,j} \phi_{i,j-1} - Q^C_{i,j} \phi_{i,j} = - \V \bar{\rho_{i,j}} + Q^W_{\sigma} \sigma^W
    \end{equation}
    with $Q^W_{\sigma} =  S^W_{i,j} \frac{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i-1}}{\epsilon_{i,j}d_{i-1}+\epsilon_{i-1,j}d_{i}}$.



  \subsection{Verifications}
    We verify the discretization by modeling a \ac{1D} capacitor.
    The relative permittivity of the dielectric inside the capacitor (from $x=0.4$ to $0.6$) is set to $\epsr = 8$, and a surface charge of  $\sigma = 8$~nC.cm$^{-2}$ is imposed on one side, and $-8$~nC.cm$^{-2}$ on the other side.
    The expected electric field in the capacitor using the infinite plane approximation is $E = \sigma/(\epsilon_0\epsr) = 1.15$~kV.mm$^{-1}$.

    \Cref{fig-surface} shows the electric field computed using the obtained decomposition.
    We see that we obtain the expected value for the electric field.


    \begin{figure}[hbtp]
      \label{fig-surface}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\defaultwidth]{potential.pdf}
      \caption{Electric field of the capacitor configuration calculated by the Poisson solver in order to validate the discretization and the solver. }
    \end{figure}


  \subsection{Interface at the cell centre}
    In the previous section, we supposed that the plasma-dielectric dielectric boundary was at the interface between the cells.
    However, this means that the electric field close to the interface is unknown, as it is defined at the cell center.
    Moreover, the Dirichlet condition for the potential is better defined at the cell center, and for sake of simplicity, changing the boundary conditions should not change the particle domain.
    Hence, we chose to position the plasma-wall interface at the center of the cell.
    This means that the permittivity is not constant over a cell.

    Because the wall boundaries are only in the radial directions, we consider only an interface in the North-South direction.
    \Cref{fig-decompo2} shows the domain decomposition.
    The decomposition is the same as previously, except for the permittivity that can have two different values\string: one in the North half-plane${\epsr}_{, i,j}^n$ and another in the South half plane${\epsr}_{, i,j}^s$.

    \begin{figure}[hbt]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\defaultwidth]{discrect2.pdf}
      \caption{Cartesian decomposition of the \ac{2D} domain. The dash lines represent discontinuities in the permittivity value.}
      \label{fig-decompo2}
    \end{figure}

    The discretization of the Poisson \cref{eq-poissonsum} is follows the same path as previously,except that the electric flux in equation in not constant any more, so that \cref{eq-poissonsum} becomes
    \begin{equation}
    \oint_{\C} (-\epsilon \grad \phi) \cdot \vect{n} dS = \sum_{k\in(E,W,N,S)} S^k_{i,j} <\vect{D}^k_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n}>.
    \end{equation}

    We can define
    \begin{align}
    <\vect{D}^E_{i,j} \cdot \vect{n} >&= \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{i,j}^N E_{x, i+1/2,j}^- + \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{i,j}^S E_{x, i+1/2,j}^-\\
     &= \frac{-1}{2} (\epsilon_{i,j}^N + \epsilon_{i,j}^S) \frac{\phi_{i+1/2,j} - \phi_{i,j}}{d_i/2}
     \label{eq-flux}
    \end{align}
    so that in the Est-West direction, the flux behave as if the cell permittivity is the mean of the North and South half plane$\epsilon_{i,j} = \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_{i,j}^N + \epsilon_{i,j}^S)$.
    Hence, the rest of the computation is similar.
    For the boundary North and South, the permittivity is constant, hence there is no modification.
    Consequently, we obtain the discretization
    \begin{equation}
    S^E_{i,j} Q^E_{i,j} \phi_{i+1,j} + S^W_{i,j} Q^W_{i,j} \phi_{i-1,j} + S^N_{i,j} Q^N_{i,j} \phi_{i,j+1} + S^S_{i,j} Q^S_{i,j} \phi_{i,j-1} - Q^C_{i,j} \phi_{i,j} = - \V \bar{\rho_{i,j}}
    \label{eq-descretPoissoncentered}
    \end{equation}
    with
    \begin{center}
     $\begin{dcases}
     Q^E_{i,j} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j} \epsilon_{i+1,j}}{\epsilon_{i,j} d_{i+1} + \epsilon_{i+1,j} d_i} \\
     Q^W_{i,j} &= Q^E_{i-1,j} \\
     Q^N_{i,j} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j}^N \epsilon_{i,j+1}^S}{\epsilon_{i,j}^N d_{j+1} + \epsilon_{i,j+1}^S d_{j}}\\
     Q^S_{i,j} &= 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j}^S \epsilon_{i,j-1}^N}{\epsilon_{i,j}^S d_{j+1} + \epsilon_{i,j-1}^N d_{j}} \\
     Q^C_{i,j} &= Q^E_{i,j}S^E_{i,j}+Q^W_{i,j}S^W_{i,j}+Q^N_{i,j}S^N_{i,j}+Q^S_{i,j}S^S_{i,j}
     \end{dcases}$
    \end{center}

    As well as $S^E_{i,j} = S^W_{i,j} =d_id_z, S^N_{i,j} = S^S_{i,j}= d_jd_z$ et $\V = d_jd_id_z$.
    Here, the system is no more symmetric.
    However, we can suppose that the only permittivity jump happens at the cell center, so that  $\epsilon_{i,j}^S = \epsilon_{i,j-1}^N$.
    Hence, $Q^N_{i,j} = 2\frac{\epsilon_{i,j}^N}{ d_{j+1} + d_{j}}$ and the system is symmetric.

  \subsection{Surface charges for centred interface}
    in the case of centered plasma-wall interface, we have surfaces charges at the center of the cell.
    Hence
    \begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega_{i,j}} \rho dv = \Omega_{i,j}\bar{\rho} + S_{i,j}^N \sigma_{i,j}.
    \end{equation}
    The surface charges behave like volume charges.
    Hence, we obtain
    \begin{equation}
    S^E_{i,j} Q^E_{i,j} \phi_{i+1,j} + S^W_{i,j} Q^W_{i,j} \phi_{i-1,j} + S^N_{i,j} Q^N_{i,j} \phi_{i,j+1} + S^S_{i,j} Q^S_{i,j} \phi_{i,j-1} - Q^C_{i,j} \phi_{i,j} = - \V \bar{\rho_{i,j}} - S^N_{i,j} \sigma_{i,j}
    \end{equation}

    The discretization obtained for the plasma-wall interface cell-centred is very similar to the one obtained for the interface at the cell interface.
    However, it conserves the particle domain when the dielectric layer is not modeled and that Dirichlet conditions are applied, and the electric field at the plasma-wall interface is better defined.
    Hence, the cell-centred interface will be used.
