\section{Elements of the 2D PIC-MCC simulations}
  \label{sec-elements}
  \subsection{Principe of the PIC simulations}

    The \ac{PIC} simulation models particles moving freely on a grid.
    The grid is used to compute the electric field, in the electrostatic approximation by solving the Poisson equation

    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq-poisson}
      \Delta \phi = - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
    \end{equation}

    where $\phi$ is the electric potential, $\rho$ is the charge density, and $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity.
    If the electrostatic approximation is not correct, one need to solve the Maxwell equations.

    The particles move following the Lorenz forces
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq-Lor}
      m \vec{a} = q \vect{E} + q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
    \end{equation}
    with $m$ and $q$ the particle mass and electric charge respectively.
    The numerical particles followed in the simulations correspond to $q_f$ physical particles, with
    \begin{equation}
      q_f = \frac{n V}{\Npc}
    \end{equation}
    with $n$ the particle density, $V$ the volume of a cell, and $\Npc$ the number of numerical particle in a cell.
    A large enough number of particle is needed in order to obtain physical results.
    Indeed, insufficient number of particles leads to numerical heating \cite{ueda1994}.
    Usually, a minimum of 100 particles per cell are used, but recent results seem to encourage to use more particle \cite{janhunen2018}.

  \subsection{Monte Carlo collisions}

    In \ac{PIC} simulations, collisions between charged and neutral particles can be modeled by binary collision, but this approach is computationally costly.
    Instead, a Monte-Carlo algorithm can be used \cite{vahedi1995}.
    This approach is very efficient, and allow scattering, momentum transfer and ionization to be consistently modeled.
    The propellant used in \ac{HET} usually is \ac{Xe}, even if the recent constellation Starlink uses \ac{Kr}.
    The cross sections used for modeling \ac{Xe} or other gases collisions are taken from the {\sc LXCat} database project \cite{LXCat_web}.
    Except if otherwise stated, the elastic, inelastic scattering and ionization reactions listed in \cref{tab-reactXe} are used.
    The cross section values are summarised in \cref{fig-xexsection}.

\section{Numerical implementation of the Particle in cell simulation}

  \LPPic is an explicit electrostatic \ac{PIC}-\ac{MCC} simulation code.
  Every time-steps, the simulation loop presented in \cref{fig-picloop} is computed.
  The different steps constituting the PIC-loop are described in the next subsections.
  \begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{picloop.png}
    \caption{\ac{PIC}-\ac{MCC} loop executed every time steps.}
    \label{fig-picloop}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Data used}
    In the \ac{PIC} simulations, there are two kind of data used\string:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Particles (electron, ions, neutral can be followed as well but not in \LPPic)
      \item Mesh, also named fields (densities, electric and magnetic fields, and so on)
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Particles\\}
    For each particles, are known its position $\vec{x}$ and its velocity $\vec{v}$.
    In most \ac{PIC}-\ac{MCC} simulations, the 3 directions of the velocity vector are followed in order to in order to take into account scattering.
    It is abbreviated as \acs{3V}.
    
    \paragraph{Fields\\}
    The fields are defined at the center of each cell of the mesh.
    The charge density $\rho$ is computed by depositing the particle on the mesh, using the Cloud-in-cell model \cite{birdsall1991}.
    The electric field at the position of the particle is also obtain by bi-linear interpolation.
    The mesh dimension defines the dimension of the simulation.
    It is usual to find \acs{1D}\acs{3V} or \acs{2D}\acs{3V} \ac{PIC} simulations, for particles with 3 directions on the velocity but 1 (or 2) dimensions in space.

    \subsection{Particle pusher}
    The interaction of the movement equation \cref{eq-Lor} is different for magnetized and non-magnetized particles.

    For non-magnetized particles, we use the leapfrog scheme \cite{birdsall1991}
    \begin{align}\label{eq-leapfrog}
      \vect{v}^t &= \vect{v}^{t-1} + \frac{q}{m} \vect{E} \dt, \\
      \vect{x}^t &= \vect{x}^{t-1} + \vect{v}^t \dt,
    \end{align}
    with the superscript $t$ designing the time step, $q$ and $m$ the particle electric charge and mass, $\vect{E}$ the electric field at the particle position, and \dt the time step duration.

    It is important to note that the leapfrog induces a shift of $\frac{\dt}{2}$ between the position and the velocity, as illustrated in \cref{fig-leapfrog}.
    \begin{figure}[hbtp]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\defaultwidth]{leapfrog.png}
      \caption{Illustration of the shift between the particle velocity and position.}
      \label{fig-leapfrog}
    \end{figure}
    This shift can leads to erroneous diagnostics when computing moments of the particles distribution.
    For instance, the mean velocity of an ensemble of $N$ particle at the instant $t$ is computed as\string:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq-meanv}
      \mean{\vect{v}}^t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \lp \vect{v_i}^t + \frac{q}{m} \vect{E_i} \frac{\dt}{2} \rp.
    \end{equation}
    Other moments like the mean energy or heat flux follow the same correction.
    We can see that the error between $\mean{\vect{v}}$ defined above and
    $$ \tilde{\vect{v}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N  \vect{v_i}^t $$
    is
    $$ \mean{\vect{v}} - \tilde{\vect{v}} =\frac{q \dt}{2 m}  \frac{1}{N}  \sum_i^N  \vect{E_i} .$$
    Hence, the error in the diagnostic is larger in the region of large electric field (as in the sheaths).

    \paragraph{Magnetized particles}
    For magnetized particles, we use a modification of the leapfrog algorithm proposed by Boris \cite{boris1970}.
    It correspond to an operator splitting between the electrostatic acceleration and the magnetic rotation.
    This splitting is describe below\string:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item accelerate the particle during $\frac{\dt}{2}$ \string: $\vect{v}^{t-\frac{\dt}{2}} = \vect{v}^{t-1} + \frac{q}{m} \vect{E} \frac{\dt}{2}$
      \item rotate the particle velocity with the magnetic field
      \item accelerate the particle during $\frac{\dt}{2}$ \string: $\vect{v}^t = \vect{v}^{t-\frac{\dt}{2}} + \frac{q}{m} \vect{E} \frac{\dt}{2}$
    \end{enumerate}


  \subsection{Poisson equation solver}
  \label{subsec-poissonintro}

    The Poisson equation \cref{eq-poisson} is an elliptic equation.
    We can directly discretize the differential operator by finite volume on the cell mesh.
    The formal discretization is develop in \cref{sec-diel}, but a short summary is given here.

    In \ac{1D}, the obtained linear system is tridiagnonal.
    It can be solve directly using {\sc Thomas} algorithm, which simply stores the Gauss elimination's coefficient.
    In \ac{2D}, the linear system is pentadiagonal.
    A direct solver, like the $LU$ decomposition, would require a large amount a memory to store the factorisation matrices.
    On the other hand, as the time step is usually small in \ac{PIC} simulation, we expect the plasma potential $\phi$ not to change rapidly.
    Hence, an iterative solver using the previous solution as initial guess seems more reasonable fro both the memory storage and the computational time.

    In practice, we uses {\sc Hypre}'s multigrid solver to solve Poisson equation in \ac{2D} in \LPPic.
