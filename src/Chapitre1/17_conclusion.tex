\section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec-conclusion_ch1}
  
  In order to study the plasma wall interaction in an \ac{HET}, we developed a bi-dimensional simulation code using \ac{PIC}-\ac{MCC} modeling.
  As the electrons drift azimuthally due to the $E \times B$ configuration, the \ac{ECDI} rises, enhancing the cross field transport of the electron toward the anode.
  The walls closing the chamber in the radial direction are also important for the discharge behaviour.
  Hence, in order to compare the interaction between these phenomena, we simulate the radial-azimuthal domain.
  
  A special care have been taken concerning
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the modeling of the axial convection, in order to model the energy losses and so attain a steady state,
    \item the modeling of the radial boundary with the dielectric layer included in the simulation domain.
  \end{itemize}
