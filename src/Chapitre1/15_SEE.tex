\section{Electron induced secondary electron emission from the wall}
\label{sec-seemodel}
When an incident electron reaches the wall material, several scenarii are possible, as described in \citet{villemant2018}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Elastic reflection\string: the electron encounters only elastic collision with the material, hence its energy is constant. However, its reflection is not necessary specular.
  \item Inelastic reflection\string: the electron looses some of its energy to the material before returning to the plasma.
  \item Secondary electron emission\string: the energy of the primary electron is enough to extract one or more electrons from the material.
  \item No emission, the electron is absorbed by the wall.
\end{enumerate}

The probability \proba{}  that one event happens instead of another depends predominantly on the particle energy, and weakly on its  impact angle.
Concerning the mean flux of electron incident and emitted, we uses the mean emission rate, or yield, \rate
\begin{equation*} \label{eq-ratedifinition}
  \rate = \frac{\Gamma_{e, \rm secondary}}{\Gamma_{e, \rm primary}}
\end{equation*}
which can be developed using the distribution function to 
\begin{equation*} \label{eq-ratedifinition_evdf}
  \rate = \frac{\iiint_{\Omega} v_x \proba(\vect{v_e}) f(\vect{v_e}) d^3v}{\iiint_{\Omega} v_x \proba(\vect{v_e}) f(\vect{v_e}) d^3v}
\end{equation*}
with $\Omega$ the ensemble of $\vect{v_e}$ directed toward the wall\string: $\vect{v_e} \cdot \vect{n} > 0$, with $\vect{n} $ the unit vector normal to and toward the wall.

\subsection{Models of emission } \label{subsec-seemodels}
Several models can be used to describe the electron emission.

\paragraph{Monte Carlo models} are the more realistic.
 They are based on the computation of the trajectory of the electrons through the material, during which the electron can encounter several interactions with the material.
 Each interactions can modify the electron direction, energy, and generate new electron.
 Several models have been proposed, as \citet{furman2002,pierron2017}.
 These models allow a precise characterization of the processes, but depends on a large number of parameters difficult to obtain due to the lack of experimental data.
 
\paragraph{Analytical models} provides a simplified description of the rate of emission.
Their complexity depends on the precision desired.
The most largely used are the models of \citet{vaughan1989,barral2003a,sydorenko2006b}.

In this work, we are interested only in representing qualitatively the electron emission.
Moreover, \citet{croes2017} showed that changing the model used do not affect significantly the results. 
Hence, we will use the model of \citet{barral2003a} for its simplicity.

\subsection{Barral electron emission model}
\label{sec-modelused}

The emission model used follows a linear-saturated law for the probability of emission with three parameters. 
It describes the total emission corresponding to the sum of the elastic and inelastic backscattering and the secondary electron emission.
\begin{equation} \label{eq-proba_barral}
  \proba(\ek) = 
  \begin{cases}
    \proba_0 + (1 - \proba_0) \frac{\ek}{\crover}   &\text{ if } \ek <  \ek_{\max} \\
    \probamax &\text{ if } \ek \geq \ek_{\max}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\ek$ is the kinetic energy of the incoming electron, $\proba_0$ is the asymptotic probability of emission at energy null, $\crover$ is the crossover energy above which the probability of emission is higher that one, \probamax is the maximum probability and $\ek_{\max}= \frac{\probamax - \proba_0}{1 - \proba_0} \crover $ is the minimum energy for which $\rate = \probamax$.
\Cref{eq-proba_barral} is illustrated in \Cref{fig-modelbarral}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\defaultwidth]{barral}
  \caption{Linear-saturated emission model from \citet{barral2003a}.}
  \label{fig-modelbarral}
\end{figure}

 We suppose that all of the electrons emitted are isotropically emitted following a Maxwellian flux distribution function of temperature $\Tsee$.
 The parameters $\proba_0$,  $\probamax$ and $\crover$ can be obtained from experiments. 
 \Cref{tab-seeparames} shows the crossover energy and the  probability of emission at energy null for different materials.
 The value of $\proba_0$ is always close to $0.5$, but $\crover$ can vary from 18 to 305 V.
 Hence, in the following parametric studies, $\proba_0$ will be kept at 0.5 while we vary $\crover$ from low values, corresponding to highly emmissive materials, to high values, representing less emmissive materials.

   \caption{Emission parameters for different materials, from \citet{barral2003a}.}
   \label{tab-seeparames}
   \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}} \toprule
   Material & $\crover$ (V)& $\proba_0$ \\ \midrule
   BN-SiO$_2$ & 53 & 0.45 \\ 
   Al$_2$O$_3$ & 18  & 0.57 \\ 
   SiC     &  43  &0.69  \\
   Graphite & 305  & 0.40 \\ 
   \bottomrule
   \end{tabular}
 \end{table}
 
 Since the model used describe both the reflected and true secondary electron emission, we will use the general name \emph{electron emission}  to refer to the flux of electron comming from the wall toward the plasma.
 In contrast, the electrons reaching the plasma are referred to as the \emph{primary electrons}.
