  abstract = {In order to facilitate the development of the next generation of electric propulsion (EP) devices for USAF space assets and overcome current limitations in power density and specific mass, investigators from Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), University of Alabama (UA), and George Washington University (GWU) performed a comprehensive multidisciplinary study on the nature and transport properties of the interaction between a plasma and a confining wall material. In year five, the High-Power Electric Propulsion lab at GT continued research into plasma sheath physics. Hysteresis effects observed in the floating potential of wall material samples immersed in a lowtemperature plasma were studied. Hysteresis is found to be due to secondary electron emission from the wall material surface. The University of Alabama performed two studies in year five. The first effort investigated the influence of surface roughness on electron emission from graphite and graphite coated HET materials. The second study was performed in concert with the sheath experiments conducted at HPEPL: Investigating the effect of Debye-scale surface features on space charge saturation of plasma sheaths. In year five, the Computational Solid Mechanics Lab (CSML) at Georgia Tech created models of the development of cracks in polycrystalline materials. Preliminary results have proven that the thermal conductivity distribution largely impacts the crack nucleation and propagation process. In addition, CSML contributed towards a concurrent multi-scale model capable of predicting the thermo-mechanical response of polycrystalline structures including crack nucleation and propagation. The experimental investigation of the erosion of stressed materials was continued for fused silica and M26 borosil. The cell pattern observed created on fused silica samples was successfully modeled as a result of the angle-dependence of the sputtering yield of fused silica. Unlike fused silica, the work shows that the evolution of the M26 surface is governed by the complex microstructure of the material.},

  abstract = {Particle velocity distributions measured in collisionless space plasmas often show strong deviations from idealized model distributions. Despite this observational evidence, linear wave analysis in space plasma environments such as the solar wind or Earth's magnetosphere is still mainly carried out using dispersion relation solvers based on Maxwellians or other parametric models. To enable a more realistic analysis, we present the new grid-based kinetic dispersion relation solver LEOPARD (Linear Electromagnetic Oscillations in Plasmas with Arbitrary Rotationally-symmetric Distributions) which no longer requires prescribed model distributions but allows for arbitrary gyrotropic distribution functions. In this work, we discuss the underlying numerical scheme of the code and we show a few exemplary benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate a first application of LEOPARD to ion distribution data obtained from hybrid simulations. In particular, we show that in the saturation stage of the parallel fire hose instability, the deformation of the initial bi-Maxwellian distribution invalidates the use of standard dispersion relation solvers. A linear solver based on bi-Maxwellians predicts further growth even after saturation, while LEOPARD correctly indicates vanishing growth rates. We also discuss how this complies with former studies on the validity of quasilinear theory for the resonant fire hose. In the end, we briefly comment on the role of LEOPARD in directly analyzing spacecraft data, and we refer to an upcoming paper which demonstrates a first application of that kind.},

Boron neutral 249.677 and 249.773nm lines were measured using a high resolution spectrometer. Spectral measurement results and the accompanying analysis and discussion are presented in this study. From the spectral measurements it was observed that the Boron emission intensity significantly increases for increased discharge voltage pointing to a large increase in the thruster wall erosion rate. Additionally, the measurements show that for the nominal discharge voltage and the applied magnetic field intensity, there is an optimum propellant flow rate for minimum Boron emission, thus minimum wall erosion rate. The variation in the current to the magnet coils showed that the Boron emission intensity increases for increased magnetic field and the Boron emission intensity shows similar behavior to that of the Xenon single ion emission line intensity at 248.911nm. The findings of the study show that emission spectroscopy can be used in determining the optimum operational parameters for minimum wall erosion for SPT type Hall thrusters.},

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {This paper presents simulations of an air plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure in a point-to-plane configuration with a dielectric layer in the path of the discharge. First, the dielectric layer is placed on the cathode plane and we study the influence of the permittivity and thickness of the dielectric on the positive streamer discharge dynamics and the dielectric surface charging. We show that the velocity of the surface discharge on the dielectric surface depends on the capacitance of the dielectric layer and decreases as this capacitance increases. Conversely, the amount of positive surface charge deposited by the positive surface discharge on the dielectric surface is not directly related to the value of the capacitance of the dielectric layer. However, the amount of surface charge deposited increases as the capacitance of the dielectric layer increases. Second, the dielectric layer is placed in the air gap as an obstacle for the propagation of the first streamer discharge ignited at the point electrode. In this case, after the impact on the dielectric, the first discharge spreads along the upper dielectric surface and we show that, depending on the location of the dielectric layer, its permittivity, its thickness and its opacity to radiation, a second discharge may reignite or not below the dielectric layer. During the discharge dynamics, positive charges are deposited on the upper surface of the dielectric and negative charges are deposited on its bottom surface. For all conditions studied in this work, we show that surface charge deposition on both faces of the dielectric layer has a small influence on the discharge reignition below the dielectric layer. Finally, with two closely spaced dielectric layers in the path of the discharge, a series of spreading/reignition for each dielectric layer is observed.},

Dispersive, nonlinear wave propagation in high current beams is found to be similar to ion-acoustic waves in plasmas with an analogy between Debye screening and beam pipe shielding. Exact longitudinal solitary wave propagation is found for potentials associated with certain transverse distributions which fill the beam pipe. For weak dispersion, the waves satisfy the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, but for strong dispersion they exhibit breaking. More physically realizable distributions which do not fill the beam pipe are investigated and shown to also satisfy a KdV equation for weak dispersion if averaging over rapid transverse motion is physically justified. Scaling laws are presented to explore likely parameter regimes where these phenomena may be observed experimentally.},

  title = {Fully-{{Kinetic PIC Simulations}} for {{Hall}}-{{Effect Thrusters}}},
  abstract = {In recent years, many groups have numerically modeled the near-anode region of a Hall thruster in attempts to better understand the associated physics of thruster operation. Originally, simulations assumed a continuum approximation for electrons and used magnetohydrodynamic fluid equations to model the significant processes. While these codes were computationally efficient, their applicability to nonequilibrated regions of the thruster, such as wall sheaths, was limited, and their accuracy was predicated upon the notion that the energy distributions of the various species remained Maxwellian at all times. The next generation of simulations used the fully-kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) model. Although much more computationally expensive than the fluid codes, the full-PIC codes allowed for non-equilibrated thruster regions and did not rely on Maxwellian distributions. However, these simulations suffered for two main reasons. First, due to the high computational cost, fine meshing near boundaries which would have been required to properly resolve wall sheaths was often not attempted. Second, PIC is inherently a statistically noisy method and often the extreme tails of energy distributions would not be adequately sampled due to high energy particle dissipation.},

The experimental uncertainty for the emission yield corresponds to a factor of two variation in the cathode current. If the emission yield is tuned to make the cathode current computed by each code match the experiment, the computed electric fields are in excellent agreement with each other, and within about 10\% of the experimental value. The non-monotonic variation of the width of the cathode fall with the applied voltage seen in the experiment is reproduced by both codes. The electron temperature in the negative glow is within experimental error bars for both codes, but the density of slow trapped electrons is underestimated. A more detailed code comparison done for several synthetic cases of electron-beam injection into helium gas shows that the codes are in excellent agreement for ionization rate, as well as for elastic and excitation collisions with isotropic scattering pattern. The remaining significant discrepancies between the two codes are due to differences in their electron binary-collision models, and for anisotropic scattering due to elastic and excitation collisions.},

The simulated system is a plasma slab bounded by dielectric walls with secondary electron emission. An external, accelerating electric field directed parallel to the walls and an external magnetic field directed normal to the walls are applied. The strongly anisotropic non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution function is obtained in simulations. The average energy of electron motion parallel to the walls is defined by collisional heating in the accelerating electric field. This energy is much higher than the average energy of electron motion normal to the walls, which is determined by the energy of electrons produced in ionization and by scattering of electrons by neutral atoms. The electron distribution function for velocity components normal to the walls is depleted for energies above the near-wall plasma potential. The effects of Coulomb collisions on the electron velocity distribution function and electron wall losses are studied.},

The 1D-model presented aims at showing the main trends whereas the results obtained within the 3D-model, also developed, confirm the 2D-model description. The models outline the importance of the transport phenomena: electron-energy and charged-particle fluxes. Reduction of the thermal flux across the magnetic field together with thermal diffusion and diffusion, acting in combination, is the basis of the electron cooling and of the spatial distribution of the electron density.

  title = {Fundamental Statistical Descriptions of Plasma Turbulence in Magnetic {\"Y}elds},
  abstract = {A pedagogical review of the historical development and current status (as of early 2000) of systematic statistical theories of plasma turbulence is undertaken. Emphasis is on conceptual foundations and methodology, not practical applications. Particular attention is paid to equations and formalism appropriate to strongly magnetized, fully ionized plasmas. Extensive reference to the literature on neutral- uid turbulence is made, but the unique properties and problems of plasmas are emphasized throughout. Discussions are given of quasilinear theory, weak-turbulence theory, resonance-broadening theory, and the clump algorithm. The direct-interaction approximation (DIA) is developed as a central focus of the article, and its relationship to the earlier plasma theories is explained. Various methods of renormalized perturbation theory are described, then uni{\"y}ed with the aid of the generating-functional formalism of Martin, Siggia, and Rose. A general expression for the renormalized dielectric function is deduced and discussed in detail. Modern approaches such as decimation and PDF methods are described. Derivations of DIA-based Markovian closures are discussed. The eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure is shown to be nonrealizable in the presence of waves, and a new realizable Markovian closure is presented. The test-{\"y}eld model and a realizable modi{\"y}cation thereof are also summarized. Numerical solutions of various closures for some plasma-physics paradigms are reviewed. The variational approach to bounds on transport is developed. Miscellaneous topics include Onsager symmetries for turbulence, the interpretation of entropy balances for both kinetic and uid descriptions, self-organized criticality, statistical interactions between disparate scales, and the roles of both mean and random shear. Appendices are provided on Fourier transform conventions, dimensional and scaling analysis, the derivations of nonlinear gyrokinetic and gyro uid equations, stochasticity criteria for quasilinear theory, formal aspects of resonance-broadening theory, Novikov's theorem, the treatment of weak inhomogeneity, the derivation of the Vlasov and gyrokinetic weak-turbulence wave kinetic equation from a fully renormalized description, some features of a code for solving the DIA and related Markovian closures, the details of the solution of the EDQNM closure for a solvable three-wave model, and the notation used in the article. c 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are sometimes used to confine the plasma in low-pressure low-temperature gas discharges, for example in magnetron discharges, Hall-effect-thruster discharges, electron-cyclotron-resonance discharges and helicon discharges. We discuss how these magnetized discharges can be modelled by two-dimensional self-consistent models based on electron fluid equations. The magnetized electron flux is described by an anisotropic drift\textendash{}diffusion equation, where the electron mobility is much smaller perpendicular to the magnetic field than parallel to it. The electric potential is calculated either from Poisson's equation or from the electron equations, assuming quasineutrality. Although these models involve many assumptions, they are appropriate to study the main effects of the magnetic field on the charged particle transport and space charge electric fields in realistic two-dimensional discharge configurations. We demonstrate by new results that these models reproduce known phenomena such as the establishment of the Boltzmann relation along magnetic field lines, the penetration of perpendicular applied electric fields into the plasma bulk and the decrease in magnetic confinement by short-circuit wall currents. We also present an original method to prevent numerical errors arising from the extreme anisotropy of the electron mobility, which tend to invalidate model results from standard numerical methods.},

Despite this observational evidence, linear wave analysis in space plasma environments such as the solar wind or Earth's magnetosphere is still mainly carried out using dispersion relation solvers based on Maxwellians or other parametric models. To enable a more realistic analysis, we present the new grid-based kinetic dispersion relation solver LEOPARD (Linear Electromagnetic Oscillations in Plasmas with Arbitrary Rotationally-symmetric Distributions) which no longer requires prescribed model distributions but allows for arbitrary gyrotropic distribution functions. In this work, we discuss the underlying numerical scheme of the code and we show a few exemplary benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate a first application of LEOPARD to ion distribution data obtained from hybrid simulations. In particular, we show that in the saturation stage of the parallel fire hose instability, the deformation of the initial bi-Maxwellian distribution invalidates the use of standard dispersion relation solvers. A linear solver based on bi-Maxwellians predicts further growth even after saturation, while LEOPARD correctly indicates vanishing growth rates. We also discuss how this complies with former studies on the validity of quasilinear theory for the resonant fire hose. In the end, we briefly comment on the role of LEOPARD in directly analyzing spacecraft data, and we refer to an upcoming paper which demonstrates a first application of that kind.},

In some regards, this article is also an attempted synthesis of the differing views of these thrusters found in literature, as well as in our own work. In a closed drift thruster, the electric field that accelerates the ions is established by an electron current that passes through and is impeded by a magnetic field. The precessing electrons in this magnetic field follow a closed drift path giving this thruster its name. Closed drift thrusters are divided into magnetic layer and anode layer types, based both on the geometrical and material differences in the discharge channels of the two types, and on the different physical processes that take place within the discharge plasma.

  volume = {27},
  abstract = {Using a self-consistent 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, we investigate the electron transport in Hall-effect thrusters. The PIC simulation is explicit in time and models the axial and azimuthal directions of a thruster without using any artificial parametric or geometric scaling factors. The applied discharge voltage and external magnetic field causes electrons to drift in the azimuthal direction, and this drives an instability in the plasma that produces large amplitude oscillations in both the plasma density and azimuthal electric field. A Fourier transform in time and space shows that the oscillations follow a dispersion relation similiar to that for an ion acoustic instability (in agreement with a recent kinetic theory). Correlated with the presence of this instability is an enhanced electron cross-field transport; even in the absence of electron-wall collisions and secondary electron emission. The amplitude of plasma density oscillations (but not electric field oscillations) is found to decrease significantly in a region just downstream of the thruster exit (before then increasing again), and reaches levels similar to those measured experimentally with collective light scattering techniques. By taking relevant velocity moments of the electron distribution function in the PIC simulations, we reconstruct each term in the electron momentum conservation equation and demonstrate that `anomalous' electron transport can be explained entirely due to an instability-enhanced friction force between electrons and ions. This friction force acts as an additional momentum loss allowing electrons to cross the magnetic field, and as an accelerating force causing ions to rotate azimuthally in the same direction as the electrons. Clear evidence of ion-wave trapping in the instability electric field is observed.},

Based on these results, a number of fundamentally new plasma-dynamic systems were proposed; in particular, the principles of plasma optics were formulated and verified experimentally. In the course of these investigations, new physical processes, such as the formation of the distribution function of the electrons in their collisions with the wall and the effect of the near-wall conductivity, were discovered.

  abstract = {An improved radial particle-in-cell model of an annular Hall effect thruster discharge with secondary-electron emission from the walls and a radial magnetic field is presented. New algorithms are implemented: first, to adjust the mean neutral density to the desired mean plasma density; second, to avoid the refreshing of axially accelerated particles; and third, to correctly weigh lowdensity populations (such as secondary electrons). The high-energy tails of the velocity distribution functions of primary and secondary electrons from each wall are largely depleted, leading to temperature anisotropies for each species. The secondary-electron populations are found to be partially recollected by the walls and partially transferred to the primary population. The replenishment ratio of the primary high-energy tail is determined based on the sheath potential fall. Significant asymmetries at the inner and outer walls are found for the collected currents, the mean impact energy, and the wall and sheath potentials. Radial profiles in the plasma bulk are asymmetric too, due to a combination of the geometric expansion, the magnetic mirror effect, and the centrifugal force (emanating from the E \texttimes{} B drift). The temperature anisotropy and non-uniformity, and the centrifugal force modify the classical Boltzmann relation on electrons along the magnetic lines.},

Free energy from these sources make such plasmas prone to various instabilities resulting in turbulence, anomalous transport, and appearance of coherent structures as found in experiments. This paper provides an overview of instabilities that exist in such plasmas. A nonlinear fluid model has been developed for description of the Simon-Hoh, lower-hybrid and ion-sound instabilities. The model also incorporates electron gyroviscosity describing the effects of finite electron temperature. The nonlinear fluid model has been implemented in the BOUT++ framework. The results of nonlinear simulations are presented demonstrating turbulence, anomalous current and tendency toward the formation of coherent structures.},

Significant improvements in the accuracy of EEDFs determined using optical diagnostics on argon-containing inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) are possible by fitting an analytic representation of the EEDF with two adjustable parameters (x and Tx) to recorded optical emission spectra. This so-called x-form of the EEDF captures the well-known suppression of the high-energy portion of the EEDF (compared with the Maxwellian form) observed in ICPs. A review of electron kinetics summarizes the physical mechanisms that lead to this form, and explains the weak dependence of x on operating pressure. For the 1\textendash{}25 mTorr pressure range of argon-containing mixtures in the system examined, the fixed value x = 1.2 is found to represent the EEDF very well, followed by a near linear increase in x with pressure from x = 1.2 to 1.6 in the 25\textendash{}50 mTorr range. Significantly improved agreement between predictions of effective electron temperature with a global model and both probe and optical measurements when a Maxwellian EEDF is replaced by the x-form further highlights the benefit of the x-form in improved accuracy in determining the EEDF with optical diagnostics.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Global models are commonly employed to study chemically complex low temperature, low-pressure plasma discharges. However, due in part to the inherent non-uniformity of charged species density in confined plasmas, these models are often regarded as crude first-order approximations. This view is supported by the literature, where global models typically give only broad qualitative agreement when compared with experimental measurements. Recently, the present authors have argued against such comparisons being a useful indicator of the validity of the underlying model assumptions. Choosing instead to quantify the validity of a relatively simple global model by comparing it with a one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation, they found the two treatments to be in quite good agreement over an extended region of parameter space. This paper is an attempt to offer further insight into this result.},

  abstract = {A first step towards understanding a complex plasma is usually to develop a zero-dimensional or global model. This is difficult when the plasma is electronegative, because the literature contains many proposed models with different and sometimes contradictory detailed assumptions, and different domains of applicability. The appropriateness of such models in a given context is often hard to assess. In this paper, we present a set of detailed kinetic simulations spanning a wide of range of parameters, especially with respect to electronegativity, collisionality and dominant negative ion destruction mechanism. We use these simulations as a benchmark to investigate the validity of the fundamental global model assumptions when used to model electronegative discharges. We reach two important conclusions: (1) that an accurate electron kinetics model is more important than detailed considerations relating to plasma dynamics in the presence of negative ions and (2) that there exists a simple and robust transport model that is in reasonable agreement with all of our benchmark simulations, when the electrons are treated properly.},

  title = {Hall Thruster Operation with Externally Driven Breathing Mode Oscillations},
  volume = {27},
  abstract = {The discharge and plasma plume characteristics of the cylindrical Hall thruster were studied in regimes with external modulations of the applied voltage. It is found that the amplitude and the root mean square (rms) value of the discharge and ion currents increase with the amplitude of the external modulation exhibiting two different regimes. For smaller amplitudes of the modulation voltage, the oscillations amplitude and rms value of the discharge and ion currents follow the amplitude of modulations approximately linearly. For larger voltage modulations, the amplitude and the rms value of the discharge and ion currents grow faster and nonlinearly. In the nonlinear regime, the discharge and the ion currents demonstrate pronounced dependence on the frequency of the external modulations. Moreover, the rms value of the ion current is amplified stronger than the rms value of the discharge current resulting in an increase of the current utilization (of about 5\%) and the propellant utilization efficiencies (of about 40\%). The thruster efficiency, defined as a product of the current and propellant utilization coefficients, shows an increase of the about 20\%. We also present the results of theoretical modeling of a plasma response to driven oscillations in a simplified 1D model of resistive-ionization mode in quasineutral plasma. This modeling demonstrates the nonlinear property of the fundamental breathing mode similar to the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Electron energy distribution functions (EEDFs) have been measured in a cylindrical inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with a planar coil over a wide range of external parameters (argon pressure, discharge power and driving frequency). The measurements were performed under well-defined discharge conditions (discharge geometry, rf power absorbed by plasma, external electrical characteristics and electromagnetic field and rf current density profiles). Problems found in many probe measurements in ICPs were analysed and a rationale for designing probe diagnostics that addresses these problems is presented in this paper. A variety of plasma parameters, such as, plasma density, effective and screen electron temperatures, electron\textendash{}atom transport collision frequency, effective rf frequency and rates of inelastic processes, have been found as appropriate integrals of the measured EEDFs. The dependence of these ICP parameters over a wide range of argon pressure, rf power and frequency results in experimental scaling laws that are suitable for comparison with ICP models and helpful in ICP design for many applications.},

There are well-established theories for h factors in the one-dimensional (1D) case. The purpose of this paper is to establish h factors in two-dimensional (2D) systems, with guidance from a 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. We derive analytical solutions of a 2D fluid theory that includes the effect of ion inertia, but assumes a constant (independent of space) ion collision frequency (using an average ion velocity) across the discharge. Predicted h factors from this 2D fluid theory have the same order of magnitude and the same trends as the PIC simulations when the average ion velocity used in the collision frequency is set equal to the ion thermal velocity. The best agreement is obtained when the average ion velocity varies with pressure (but remains independent of space), going from half the Bohm velocity at low pressure, to the thermal velocity at high pressure. The analysis also shows that a simple correction of the widely-used 1D heuristic formula may be proposed to accurately incorporate 2D effects.},

However, the presence of anomalous electron cross-field transport is still poorly understood, and involves complex and strongly coupled mechanisms such as azimuthal electron drift instabilities and intense secondary electron emission (SEE) from the thruster walls. The present work focuses on the relative importance of these two phenomena. We use a 2D particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision model configured to simulate the radial-azimuthal directions near the thruster exit plane. A constant radial magnetic field and axial electric field are imposed, and electron drift instabilities are observed in the azimuthal ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/27/12/124001/psstaaeccdieqn4.gif] \$\textbackslash{}bfE\textbackslash{}times \textbackslash{}bfB\$ ) direction. A simplified SEE model is implemented and an extensive parametric study is performed to directly determine the effect on electron transport. It is found that, for the operating conditions used in our simulations, SEE enhances the near-wall electron mobility by a factor 2, while reducing the bulk plasma mobility by about 20\% (due to electron cooling). However, the dominant contribution to anomalous electron transport is still observed to be caused by electron drift instabilities driven by the \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/27/12/124001/psstaaeccdieqn5.gif] \$\textbackslash{}bfE\textbackslash{}times \textbackslash{}bfB\$ discharge configuration. SEE modifies the electron mobility profile, but the spatially-averaged value remains relatively constant. Three different operating regimes are identified depending on the SEE rate value: two that are stable, and a third which shows an oscillatory behaviour. In addition to electron transport, the kinetic simulations give new insight into the plasma sheath formation at the radial walls, and comparison with typical analytical sheath models demonstrate important differences.},

  abstract = {We present results from a two-dimensional (2D) numerical fluid model of rf discharges in conditions close to recently published measurements of the spatial distribution of plasma density in the Gaseous Electronic Conference reference cell. The discharge is in pure argon at pressures in the 100 mtorr range, frequency 13.56 MHz, and rf voltage amplitudes on the order of 100 V. The model is based on solutions of the continuity, momentum (drift-diffusion), and energy equations for the electrons, continuity, and drift-diffusion equation for positive ions, coupled with the Poisson equation. The results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with the experiments. The model predicts a maximum of plasma density off axis, as in the experiment. The ion current density on the electrode is also nonuniform, and increases radially in the conditions of the experiments. The effects of the rf voltage, pressure, and reactor geometry (electrode dimensions, gap length, guard rings, etc.) on the plasma properties and on the uniformity of the ion current on the powered electrode are also discussed. It is shown that the existence of a maximum of plasma density in the radial direction, in the conditions of the experiment, is due to the small value of the electrode spacing. The results show that the harmonic content of the discharge current is also geometry dependent. The comparisons show that 2D, three-moment fluid models can accurately describe the discharge and the effects of the chamber geometry on the plasma properties for pressure above the limit where collisionless electron heating does not play a significant role.},

Due to these difficulties the existence of a matched asymptotic expression uniformly valid from the plasma core to the wall is widely questioned. The issue is clarified both analytically and numerically by the explicit construction of a matched asymptotic expression and comparison with exact solutions for the hydrodynamic plane Tonks\textendash{}Langmuir problem. The approximations obtained by consistent matching show excellent agreement with numerical potential curves. The singularities of the asymptotic components are reflected by small discontinuities in the derivatives that vanish in the limit {$\lambda$} D / L \textrightarrow 0.},

Specifically, the optimization of the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm is considered. The PIC algorithm is widely use in the study of plasmas, rarified gases, fluid dynamics, and gravitational dynamics. For this algorithm, the main performance bottleneck is the deposition of charge onto the grid. The goals of the optimizations described in this paper were to maximize cache reuse to overcome memory bandwidth limitations and improve data processing speeds by taking advantage of multithreading and vector instructions. The particular techniques, discussed in detail in the paper, were sorting particles into tiles, operating on tiles in a manner that prevents race conditions, separating out the vectorizable operations (also known as strip mining), and sorting particles based on cells. Performance analysis results are given at each step of the optimization. An overall improvement of a factor of 20 in computational speed was obtained.},

In the simulations an m = 1 spoke rotating with a velocity of 6.5 km/s in the ExB direction was observed. The rotating electron density structure in the spoke is accompanied by a strongly depleted region of the neutral gas, which clearly shows that the spoke instability is of an ionization nature, similar to the axial breathing mode oscillations. In the simulation the electron cross-field transport through the spoke core was caused by diffusion in the highfrequency (4-10 MHz), short-scale (3 mm) electric field oscillations. These short-scale oscillations play a crucial role in the thruster discharge as over 70\% of the electron current to the anode originates from the spoke core. The rest of the current originates from the spoke front where the electron cross-field transport toward the anode is due to the ExB drift in the spoke macroscopic azimuthal electric field.},

  abstract = {Surface erosion and secondary electron emission (SEE) have been identified as the most critical life-limiting factors in channel walls of Hall-effect thrusters for space propulsion. Recent wall concepts based on micro-architected surfaces have been proposed to mitigate surface erosion and SEE. The idea behind these designs is to take advantage of very-high surface-to-volume ratios to reduce SEE and ion erosion by internal trapping and redeposition. This has resulted in renewed interest to study electron-electron processes in relevant thruster wall materials. In this work, we present calculations of SEE yields in micro-porous hexagonal BN surfaces using stochastic simulations of electron-material interactions in discretized surface geometries. Our model consists of two complementary parts. First we study SEE as a function of primary electron energy and incidence angle in flat surfaces using Monte Carlo simulations of electron multi-scattering processes. The results are then used to represent the response function of discrete surface elements to individual electron rays generated using a ray-tracing Monte Carlo model. We find that micro-porous surfaces result in SEE yield reductions of over 50\% in the energy range experienced in Hall thrusters. This points to the suitability of these micro-architected surface concepts to mitigate SEE-related issues in compact electric propulsion devices.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews and discusses recent experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies of plasma-wall interaction in a weakly collisional magnetized plasma bounded with channel walls made from different materials. A lowpressure E\texttimes{}B plasma discharge of the Hall thruster was used to characterize the electron current across the magnetic field and its dependence on the applied voltage and electron-induced secondary electron emission (SEE) from the channel wall. The presence of a depleted, anisotropic electron energy distribution function with beams of secondary electrons was predicted to explain the enhancement of the electron cross-field current observed in experiments. Without the SEE, the electron crossfield transport can be reduced from anomalously high to nearly classical collisional level. The suppression of SEE was achieved using an engineered carbon velvet material for the channel walls. Both theoretically and experimentally, it is shown that the electron emission from the walls can limit the maximum achievable electric field in the magnetized plasma. With nonemitting walls, the maximum electric field in the thruster can approach a fundamental limit for a quasineutral plasma.},

In this paper, we model this interaction as a stationary and bi-kinetic Vlasov-Poisson-Amp`ere boundary value problem with boundary conditions that are consistent with the physics. In particular, we show that the wall potential can be determined from the ampibolarity of the particle flows as the unique solution of a non linear equation. Based on variational techniques, our analysis establishes the wellposedness of the model, provided that the incoming ion distribution satisfies a moment condition that generalizes the historical Bohm criterion of plasma physics. Quantitative estimates are also given, together with numerical illustrations that validate the robustness of our approach.},

Based on the detailed calculations of magnetic field, temperature distribution, electron and ion energies and other vital parameters in the detailed design with specific materials, the key power fluxes and critical temperature points in the thruster could be determined. The obtained results were then compared with the available test data, and the model was verified. The paper thus proposes an architecture of the modular CAD-based approach for the fast assessment of the Hall thruster performance at the design and test stages, and could be useful to design and optimize low-thrust devices vitally required for propelling small satellites and space vehicles of various types, including Cubesats, micro-satellites and interplanetary space probes.},

Among them, RADAR, Scanning Electron Microscope and scintillators can be quoted. EE can also be a parasitic phenomenon especially for space applications (multipactor effect in wave guides, spacecraft charging, etc.). Until now, EE has essentially been described for high incident energy (superior to 100 eV). However several technologies are being developed which involved EE with low incident energy (below 100 eV). One of them is plasma thrusters for satellites applications. Toward this work, low energy EE impact (below 100 eV) on energetic balance in Stationary Plasma Thrusters (SPTs) will be discussed as well as method of measurement of this impact.},

The solution shows that the ambipolar potential, the plasma density distribution, and the ion flux to the wall are mainly governed by the cold electrons, while the ionization rate and voltage drop across the wall sheath are governed by the hot electrons. The ionization rate by direct electron impact is found to be spatially rather uniform, contrary to the T-L solution where it is proportional to the plasma density distribution. The temperature of hot electrons defined by the ionization balance is found to be close to that of the T-L solution for a mono-Maxwellian EEDF, and is in reasonable agreement with experiments carried out in a low pressure capacitance RF discharge. The energy balance for cold electrons in this discharge shows that their heating by hot electrons via Coulomb interaction is equalized by the cold electrons' escape to the RF electrodes during collapse of the RF sheath.},

  title = {Variational Formulation of Particle Algorithms for Kinetic Plasma Simulations},
  volume = {245},
  abstract = {Common time-explicit numerical methods for kinetic simulations of plasmas in the lowcollisions limit fall into two classes of algorithms: momentum conserving (also known as particle-in-cell (PIC)) and energy conserving. Each has certain drawbacks. The PIC algorithm does not conserve total energy, which may lead to spurious numerical heating (grid heating). Its overall accuracy is at most second due to the nature of the force interpolation between grid and particle position. Energy-conserving algorithms do not exhibit grid heating, but because their formulation uses potentials, computationally undesirable matrix inversions may be necessary. In addition, compared to PIC algorithms for the same accuracy, these algorithms have higher numerical noise due to the restricted choice of particle shapes. Here we formulate time-explicit, finite-size particle algorithms using particular reductions of the particle distribution function. These reductions are used in two variational principles, a Lagrangian-based and a Hamiltonian-based in conjunction with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The Lagrangian formulations here generalize previous such formulations. The Hamiltonian formulation is presented here for the first time. Many drawbacks of the two classes of particle methods are mitigated. For example, restrictions on particle shapes are relaxed in energy conserving algorithms, which can decrease the numerical noise in these methods. The Hamiltonian formulation of particle algorithms is done in terms of fields instead of potentials, thus avoiding solving Poisson's equation. An algorithm that conserves both energy and momentum is presented. Other features of the algorithms include a natural way to perform coordinate transformations, the use of various time integrating methods, and the ability to increase the overall accuracy beyond second order, including all generalizations. For clarity of presentation, we restrict our discussion to one-dimensional, non-relativistic, unmagnetized, electrostatic plasmas.},

  volume = {430},
  abstract = {High resolution dark matter only simulations provide a realistic and fully general means to study the theoretical predictions of cosmological structure formation models for gravitational lensing. Due to the finite number of particles, the density field only becomes smooth on scales beyond a few times the local mean interparticle separation. This introduces noise on the gravitational lensing properties such as the surface mass density, the deflection angles and the magnification. At some small-scale mass limit, the noise due to the discreteness of the N-body simulation becomes comparable to the effects of physical substructures. We present analytic expressions to quantify the Poisson noise and study its scaling with the particle number of the simulation and the Lagrangian smoothing size. We use the Phoenix set of simulations, currently the largest available dark matter simulations of clusters to study the effect of limited numerical resolution and the gravitational strong lensing effects of substructure. We quantify the smallest resolved substructure, in the sense that the effect of the substructure on any strong lensing property is significant compared to the noise, and we find that the result is roughly independent of the strong lensing property. A simple scaling relates the smallest resolved substructures in a simulation with the resolution of the N-body simulation.},

  abstract = {In the limit of a small Debye length (,ID0)+the analysis of the plasma boundary layer leads to a two-scale problem of a collision free sheath and of a quasi-neutral presheath. Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic featuresof the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilledand related to a sheath edge field singularity.Due to this singularity smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.},

It is found that the anomalous erosion has a self-organized structure, which is formed by the interaction between the plasma and the ceramic walls. In order to interpret the mechanism of the azimuthal erosion structure, a particle in cell (PIC) model is developed to simulate the azimuthal sheath. The results show that the electron azimuthal Hall drift due to crossed electric and magnetic field plays a key role in the azimuthal erosion evolution process. Electron Hall drift can generate an asymmetric sheath structure and induce azimuthal sheath oscillation. Furthermore, an asymmetric sheath caused by the integrated effect of the azimuthal irregular wall structure and azimuthal Hall drift will result in the azimuthal movement of ions. Based on the sheath simulated results, an erosion model is used to simulate the azimuthal erosion evolution. An asymmetric erosion profile caused by the azimuthal asymmetric ion sputtering is found.},

Grooved hexagonal boron nitride surfaces with different aspect ratios, designed to mimic the erosion channels, were exposed to an argon plasma. The characteristic size of the grooves (1 mm and 5 mm) is about of the Debye length. The secondary electrons emission from the grooved surfaces is provided by the bombardment with energetic electrons originated from the heated powered cathode. The transition between a developed and a collapsed sheaths near emissive surface takes place with an increase of the beam electron energy. For grooved emissive surfaces, the sheath transition happens at essentially higher voltage compared to the planar one. This phenomenon is analyzed in the terms of the electron energy distribution function.},

From the standpoint of practical applications, attention is focused on the near-wall conductivity in a stationary plasma thruster. The results obtained agree with the available experimental data.

  abstract = {The two particle-in-cell codes EDIPIC and LSP are benchmarked and validated for a parallel-plate glow discharge in helium, in which the axial electric field had been carefully measured, primarily to investigate and improve the fidelity of their collision models. The scattering anisotropy of electron-impact ionization, as well as the value of the secondary-electron emission yield, are not well known in this case. The experimental uncertainty for the emission yield corresponds to a factor of two variation in the cathode current. If the emission yield is tuned to make the cathode current computed by each code match the experiment, the computed electric fields are in excellent agreement with each other, and within about 10\% of the experimental value. The non-monotonic variation of the width of the cathode fall with the applied voltage seen in the experiment is reproduced by both codes. The electron temperature in the negative glow is within experimental error bars for both codes, but the density of slow trapped electrons is underestimated. A more detailed code comparison done for several synthetic cases of electron-beam injection into helium gas shows that the codes are in excellent agreement for ionization rate, as well as for elastic and excitation collisions with isotropic scattering pattern. The remaining significant discrepancies between the two codes are due to differences in their electron binarycollision models, and for anisotropic scattering due to elastic and excitation collisions.},

The solution shows that the ambipolar potential, the plasma density distribution, and the ion flux to the wall are mainly governed by the cold electrons, while the ionization rate and voltage drop across the wall sheath are governed by the hot electrons. The ionization rate by direct electron impact is found to be spatially rather uniform, contrary to the T-L solution where it is proportional to the plasma density distribution. The temperature of hot electrons defined by the ionization balance is found to be close to that of the T-L solution for a mono-Maxwellian EEDF, and is in reasonable agreement with experiments carried out in a low pressure capacitance RF discharge. The energy balance for cold electrons in this discharge shows that their heating by hot electrons via Coulomb interaction is equalized by the cold electrons' escape to the RF electrodes during collapse of the RF sheath.},

  abstract = {In this work we study the electron drift instability in Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) using a 2D electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The simulation is configured with a Cartesian coordinate system modeling the radial-azimuthal (r - \texttheta{}) plane for large radius thrusters. A magnetic field, B0, is aligned along the Oy axis (r direction), a constant applied electric field, E0, along the Oz axis (perpendicular to the simulation plane), and the E0 \texttimes{} B0 direction is along the Ox axis (\texttheta{} direction). Although electron transport can be well described by electron-neutral collisions for low plasma densities, at high densities (similar to those in typical HETs), a strong instability is observed that enhances the electron cross-field mobility; even in the absence of electron-neutral collisions. The instability generates high frequency (of the order of MHz) and short wavelength (of the order of mm) fluctuations in both the azimuthal electric field and charged particle densities, and propagates in the E0 \texttimes{} B0 direction with a velocity close to the ion sound speed. The correlation between the electric field and density fluctuations (which leads to an enhanced electron-ion friction force) is investigated and shown to be directly responsible for the increased electron transport. Results are compared with a recent kinetic theory, showing good agreement with the instability properties and electron transport.},

A onedimensional non-steady-state model of the electron dynamics is constructed that takes into account secondary electron emission. The Vlasov\textendash{}Poisson equations are solved numerically. According to the results obtained, the steady-state potential distribution that forms at a low temperature of the incident electrons gives rise to a wall layer whose characteristic thickness is about several Debye lengths and in which the electrons are decelerated. In this case, the electron density is lowest near the wall. The situation in which the temperature of the incident electrons is high is far more complicated: the solution is quasi-periodic in character and the electron density near the wall is the highest. \textcopyright{} 2002 MAIK ``Nauka/Interperiodica''.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews and discusses recent experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies of plasma-wall interaction in a weakly collisional magnetized plasma bounded with channel walls made from different materials. A low-pressure E \texttimes{} B plasma discharge of the Hall thruster was used to characterize the electron current across the magnetic field and its dependence on the applied voltage and the electron-induced secondary electron emission (SEE) from the channel wall. The presence of a depleted anisotropic electron energy distribution function with beams of secondary electrons was predicted to explain the enhancement of the electron cross-field current observed in experiments. Without the SEE, the electron cross-field transport can be reduced from anomalously high to nearly classical collisional level. The suppression of the SEE was achieved using an engineered carbon-velvet material for the channel walls. Both theoretically and experimentally, it is shown that the electron emission from the walls can limit the maximum achievable electric field in the magnetized plasma. With nonemitting walls, the maximum electric field in the thruster can approach a fundamental limit for a quasi-neutral plasma.},

Yet, none of these theories has been implemented in two-dimensional (2D) (r\textendash{}z) simulations and successfully predicted the behavior of the discharge and the erosion of a thruster over different operating conditions and geometries. We present results from numerical experiments with a 2D (r\textendash{}z) axisymmetric hydrodynamics code that show the plasma solution is relatively insensitive to very large variations in the anomalous transport in some regions of the discharge channel and near-plume. Because the changes of the plasma properties in these regions can be too small or impossible to detect in the laboratory by conventional diagnostics, the verification of a transport model becomes very challenging. Hence, without more advanced diagnostics and improved numerical models, comparisons between plasma measurements and simulation results can lead to wide-ranging theories and scalings of the anomalous resistivity.},

  abstract = {Magnetic shielding is a specific magnetic topology that can increase the lifespan of Hall thrusters by an order of magnitude. Magnetically shielded thrusters have similar performances as standard unshielded thrusters in the 5\textendash{}15 kW power range. A comparison of the performances of two 200 W shielded (ISCT200-MS) and unshielded (ISCT200-US) Hall thrusters is presented here. The effects of replacing the usual BN-SiO2 walls with graphite are investigated on both thrusters. The ISCT200-US thruster has a peak anode efficiency of 39\% and a specific impulse of 1400 s at 250 W with the ceramic discharge channel. However with graphite wall, the discharge current increases by 25\% which reduces the efficiency down to 31\% (1360 s specific impulse). The ISCT200-MS performances are significantly lower than the ISCT200-US at similar operating points. It only reaches 24\% anode efficiency and 1020 s specific impulse at 250 W. The switch to graphite has little effects on its performances below 300 V. The lower performances are due to a low propellant utilization. We propose that this low propellant utilization is caused by lower ionization near the walls which as a large impact in small thrusters due to their higher surface to volume ratio.},

Partially magnetized plasmas in HETs present unique physics in that collisions with neutral atoms (a feature of low-temperature plasmas) and instabilities and oscillations (a feature of high-temperature plasmas) coexist. A discharge plasma model is constructed by choosing the numerical methods, e.g. fluid or kinetic, for individual plasma constituents, including neutral atoms, ions, and electrons. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and collision models of a xenon discharge plasma in HETs are discussed. Various models are used to illustrate device-scale phenomena, including the breathing mode and azimuthally rotating spokes, as well as small-scale physics, such as the electron cyclotron drift instability and current-carrying instability that may occur in a hollow cathode plume.},

The corresponding anomalous cross-field transport is assessed via simultaneous time-resolved measurements of plasma potential and density. This shows a dominant large-scale E {\^A} B anomalous character of the electron cross-field current for dielectric walls reaching 40\%\textendash{}100\% of the discharge current, with an effective Hall parameter beff \$ 10.

The low energy peaks found in the measured non-Maxwellian EEDFs are attributed to non-local electron kinetics in the axially non-uniform electric field caused by standing striations. Similarly, in rf capacitive and inductive discharges, the formation of the low energy peak is a result of spatially localized electron heating combined with trapping of low energy electrons outside of the heating zone.},

  abstract = {This contribution presents a short review of electric propulsion (EP) technologies for satellites and spacecraft. Electric thrusters, also termed ion or plasma thrusters, deliver a low thrust level compared to their chemical counterparts, but they offer significant advantages for in-space propulsion as energy is uncoupled to the propellant, therefore allowing for large energy densities. Although the development of EP goes back to the 1960s, the technology potential has just begun to be fully exploited because of the increase in the available power aboard spacecraft, as demonstrated by the very recent appearance of all-electric communication satellites. This article first describes the fundamentals of EP: momentum conservation and the ideal rocket equation, specific impulse and thrust, figures of merit and a comparison with chemical propulsion. Subsequently, the influence of the power source type and characteristics on the mission profile is discussed. Plasma thrusters are classically grouped into three categories according to the thrust generation process: electrothermal, electrostatic and electromagnetic devices. The three groups, along with the associated plasma discharge and energy transfer mechanisms, are presented via a discussion of long-standing technologies like arcjet thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters and ion engines, as well as Hall thrusters and variants. More advanced concepts and new approaches for performance improvement are discussed afterwards: magnetic shielding and wall-less configurations, negative ion thrusters and plasma acceleration with a magnetic nozzle. Finally, various alternative propellant options are analyzed and possible research paths for the near future are examined.},

The FAS method splits the scattering events into two regions. At small angles it is described by cumulative scattering events resulting, via the central limit theorem, in a Gaussian-like pdf; at larger angles it is described by singleevent scatters and retains a pdf that follows the form of the Rutherford differential cross-section. The FAS method is verified using discrete Monte-Carlo scattering simulations run at small timesteps to include each individual scattering event. We identify the FAS regime of interest as where the ratio of temporal/spatial scale-of-interest to slowing-down time/length is from 10-3 to 0.3\textendash{}0.7; the upper limit corresponds to Coulomb logarithm of 20\textendash{}2, respectively. Two test problems, high-velocity interpenetrating plasma flows and keV-temperature ion equilibration, are used to highlight systems where including FAS is important to capture relevant physics.},

  abstract = {Both binary and grid-based Langevin equations models for Coulomb collisions are used in particle simulation of plasmas. We introduce a variant of the conventional binary collision algorithm for performing Coulomb collisions. In this algorithm particles in a configuration space cell are not paired for collisions. Instead, for every test particle in the cell, a unique field particle is defined by randomly sampling a velocity distribution defined on the grid by accumulating moments of the particle distribution function(s). The test and field particle pair then undergoes a collision using the standard methodology for binary collisions. The performance of the new algorithm is illustrated in example computations and compared to a drag-diffusion Langevin equations algorithm. The grid-based algorithms do not conserve momentum and energy, although with good particle statistics the non-conservation is relatively small. Conservation can be restored after collisions using a shift and scaling of the momenta. The comparative merits of the new algorithm are discussed.},

This has reached the point where research aimed at the development of CFD-based ``virtual engine test cells'' is underway, with considerable debate of the subject within the industrial and research communities. The present paper considers and illustrates the state-of-the art and prospects for advances in this field. Limitations to CFD model accuracy, the need for aero-thermo-mechanical analysis through an engine flight cycle, coupling of numerical solutions for solid and fluid domains, and timescales for capability development are considered. While the fidelity of large scale CFD models will remain limited by turbulence modelling and other issues for the foreseeable future, it is clear that use of multi-scale, multi-physics modelling in engine design will expand considerably. Development of user-friendly, versatile, efficient programs and systems for use in a massively parallel computing environment is considered a key issue.},

The input parameters of nonlinear dynamical systems are optimized to a reference solution, which can be experimental data or results from a high-fidelity computer simulation, using the Wasserstein metric and a phase-space representation of a set of time-dependent signals. Test cases shown in this paper include the Lorenz system and the discharge plasma of a Hall effect thruster to characterize the numerical uncertainties of the proposed data-driven approach, given a constructed reference solution. Distinct wells in the cost function, the Wasserstein metric, are obtained relative to the reference solution, illustrating the applicability of the proposed method to dynamical problems.

  abstract = {Brownian motion is a continuous-time process that is used to model the uncertainty in the motion of ``particles'' in different media. The process is named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown who in 1828 observed that a pollen particle suspended in a fluid continually moved randomly on the surface. Einstein (1905) suggested that the movements were due to collisions between the liquid's molecules and the relatively light pollen. Brownian motion can also be thought of as an ``infinitesimal random walk'' in which smaller and smaller steps over extremely small time intervals, which is how it often arises in many applications. Thus, it can be defined as the limit of a random walk when the time steps and the jump sizes go to zero. Although Brownian motion is everywhere continuous, it is nowhere differentiable because Brownian paths are quite rough. In fact, no matter how small a segment of the path is chosen, you will never find a segment that is a straight line. Thus, a new type of integral called the Ito integral was defined to handle the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the Brownian motion. The process is a fractal because you can zoom in on its sample path under magnification and the jaggedness never seems to smooth out. Brownian motion is used as a building block for models in several disciplines. It has been successfully used to describe thermal noise in electrical circuits, limiting behavior of queueing networks under heavy traffic, population dynamics in biological systems, and economic processes such as stock prices. In this chapter, we discuss different aspects of Brownian motion, including the geometric Brownian motion (GBM), Brownian bridge, fractional Brownian motion (FBM), Ornstein\textendash{}Uhlenbeck (OU) process, and SDE.},

  abstract = {The size of the positive space charge sheath that forms in front of an object immersed in a plasma and not dc-connected to ground with an external circuit (a floating sheath) is calculated numerically. If the sheath edge is defined as the position at which the ion fluid speed equals the Bohm speed, it is shown that the sheath size varies significantly with the discharge parameters, typically from sfloat {$\approx$} 7 {$\lambda$}Des to sfloat {$\approx$} 14 {$\lambda$}Des, where sfloat is the floating sheath size and {$\lambda$}Des is the Debye length at the sheath edge. However, if the sheath edge is defined as a significant departure from quasi-neutrality, then the floating sheath size is almost independent of the discharge parameters and may be approximated by sfloat {$\approx$} 5 {$\lambda$}Des.},
