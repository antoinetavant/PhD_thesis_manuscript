\chapter{Modeling the radial losses in an axial-azimuthal 2D PIC simulation}
\label{ch-6}

\headerchaptername{Axial Azimuthal 2D PIC simulation}

\begin{Chabstract}
  In this chapter, we modify the simulation code \LPPic in order to simulate the axial-azimuthal plane.
  This allows us to challenge the conclusion obtained from the results of the radial-azimuthal simulations.
  The impact of the radial plasma-wall interaction is also studied, using a simple model that reproduces the particle radial losses.
  Its effects on the plasma characteristics and the \ac{ECDI} are studied.
  The question of the energy transfer between the three directions is discussed.
