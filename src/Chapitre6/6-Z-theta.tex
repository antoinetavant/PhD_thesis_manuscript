\headerchaptername{Axial Azimuthal 2D PIC simulation}

\begin{Chabstract}
  We modify the simulation code \LPPic in order to simulate the axial-azimuthal simulation plane.
  This allows us to challenge the conclusion obtained from the results of the radial-azimuthal, in particular on the impact of the electron diamagnetic drift and the axial transport of the instability.
  
  The impact of the radial plasma-wall interaction is also studied.
  A simple modeled to reproduce the particle losses is included, and its impacts on the plasma characteristics and the \ac{ECDI} is studied.
   The question of the radial heating is discussed.
