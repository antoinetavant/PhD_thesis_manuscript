\chapter{Polytropic sheath model in the presence of electron emission}
\label{ch-4}

\begin{Chabstract}
  
%e modify the polytropic sheath model with secondary electron emission
We add to the non-isothermal sheath model developed in \cref{ch-3} the secondary electron emission.
using the \ac{PIC} simulations, we observe that the polytropic index is almost constant when varying the cross-over energy $\crover$.
The predictions of the polytropic sheath model are compared to the \ac{PIC} simulations results presented in \cref{ch-2}.
The modified sheath model is included in a \ac{1D} fluid model.
\end{Chabstract}

{\bf IV. Polytrotic sheath model with SEE} 20 pages
\begin{zzz}
  This chapter goes beyond the actual modified sheath model in order to add SEEs.
  This require some time to develop before writting !

  5.1 Kinetic effects of the SEE on the EVDFs  4 pages

  5.2 SEE effects on the Fluid model  5 pages

  5.3 Validation against the Parametric 2D PIC simulation results. 2 pages
  
  5.4 1D fluid model with modified wall model. 4 pages
  
  5.4Bis Global model (Vivien's) with modified wall model. 4 pages
\end{zzz}

% 
% What is complicated here is the definition of the electron temperature, that include both primary and secondary electrons.
% Should we
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Use a 2 fluid( so 1 electron) with a fluid model that includes the SEE ?
%   \item Use a 3 fluid model, that would  include folly absorbed primary electrons (simply polytropic) and emitted electrons, with strictly positive velocity.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% In the First case, the electron temperature is simple to define.
% But the closure equation may need to be changed.
% 
% the second case is more simpler, mathematicaly.
