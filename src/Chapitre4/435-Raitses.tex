    \section{Maximum electron temperature in experiments}
    
    
    In \citet{raitses2006}, the authors compare the maximum of the axial profile of the electron temperature $\hat{\Te}$ measured in a \ac{HET} with two different wall materials\string: one with a very low emissivity (carbon velvet material), the other is the conventional \ac{BN} ceramic.
    \Cref{fig-raiteses2006} reproduces the results obtained in \citet{raitses2006}.

    They observed that with the \ac{BN} ceramic the values of $\hat{\Te}$ reach a plateau.
    The value of the plateau is $\hat{\Te}^1 = 55 \pm 6\,\volt$, the error corresponds to reproducibility of the measurements (manually extracted from \citep[Fig. 3]{raitses2006}).
    In contrast the results with the low emissivity material do not present such behavior, but instead the electron temperature $\hat{\Te}$ keeps increasing linearly with the discharge voltage.
    
    The saturation of the temperature is expected to be due to the \ac{SCL} regime, which increase the electron power losses.
    For a \ac{BN} wall we have $\crover \simeq 35\,\volt$ \citep{smirnov2004}.
    The value of $\Te^1$ observed experimentally,  $\hat{\Te}^1$, is higher than the value observed in the \ac{PIC} simulations and obtained with the sheath model, which is close to $\Te^1 = 45\,\volt$.
    However, the agreement is significantly better than with the isothermal sheath model prediction 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq-Temaxisothermal}
      \Te^1_{\rm , isothermal} \simeq \frac{\crover}{2} \simeq 17.5 \,\volt.
    \end{equation}
    
    % One possible explanation of the difference between the PIC is the anisotropy of the electrons.
    % Indeed, the probe measurements measure the average electron temperature, in contrast with the sheath theory which suppose that the electrons are isotropic.
