\section{Utilisation of the modified sheath model} \label{subsec-applcation}

We have developed in the previous section a model for the plasma-wall interaction using a fluid approach, that better reproduce the interaction observed in kinetic simulations.
In this section, we try to use it in a low-dimensional fluid simulation.

\inlinenote{I tried to adapte the global model of Vivien, but it is not working well... I'm not sure what is missing / not well model, so I gave up this part for now.} 

\inlinenote{This modification of the 1D axial Fluid model (\~ Barral, Trevor, Roberto) has to be done. If I don't have time I guess it is not a big deal, but it could be greate to have !}
