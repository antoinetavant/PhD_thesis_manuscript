\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch-conclusion}


This is the conclusion.


\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 2D PIC simulation, study of SEE impact
  \item Developpement of a general DR solver, used on PIC EVDFs
  \item Isothermal sheath model do not represent well the plasma-wall interaction when electrons non-local.
  \item Developpement of polytropic law without SEE
  \item Developpement of polytropic law with SEE
  \item Developpement of impact of radial losses in Z-theta.
\end{itemize}

\section{Perspectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Physics :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Plasma-wall interaction better understood concerning the particles and power losses, given the EVDF. 
    \item Impact of the wall on the instability unclear, on both the radial wavenumber and the damping effect
    \item Radial heating due to instability unclear
    \item Non-linear behavior with particle-wave interaction and convection unclear
    \item Evolution of the electron mobility with the breathing mode
  \end{itemize}
  \item Simulation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 3D needs to be done
    \item Study of saturation and convection of ExB instability, may need Parametric study and simplified geometries
    \item Fluid model with improved kinetic instights, as polytropic sheath
    \item MonteCarlo coupling with Fluid simulation
    \item Mathematic study of new PIC algorithm, such as adaptative timesteps and mesh, merging and splitting
    \item Validation and verification of the codes
  \end{itemize}
  \item Experiment
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison between experiment and simulation parametric study
    \item Resolved non-intrusive diagnostic, as CRM model
    \item Verification of the code
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{itemize}
